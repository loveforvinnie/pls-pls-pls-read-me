# pls-pls-pls-read-me
hihi! if youre reading this you prolly saw me on ponytown!! my name is vivi, and i use she/they pronouns mostly. im from the usa, and im an italian new yorker so my accent goes hard!! i am 16, nearly 17, and taken!! i love my polish bf gang. 

if you see me as my robinette oc via, pls interact if youre kon-el!! (or just int as kon-el whenever im on heh..) ok so i prefer sitting with ppl bc i cant be alone, my ptsd goes hard even online 😭🙏. especially interact if you like invincible, dispatch, dc or marvel.. heh.. but cuddle and hide (c+h) freely.
